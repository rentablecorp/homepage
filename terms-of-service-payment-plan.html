    			  <h4>1. Introduction</h4>
    			  <p>
    				These Terms of Use (the “TOU” or “Terms”) are entered into by
    				and between you (the “Tenant”) and Rentable Finance LLC
    				(“Rentable Finance,” "Company," "we," or "us"). The following
    				terms and conditions govern your access to and use of the
    				Payment Plan services, including any content, functionality, and
    				services offered on or through the Payment Plan services. The
    				Payment Plan Services (defined below) and any additional
    				services may be provided by Rentable Finance and/or any of its
    				affiliates.
    				<br />
    				<br />
    				You must accept these Terms of Use in order to use
    				the Payment Plan Services. Please read these Terms of Use
    				carefully before you start to use the Payment Plan Services. By
    				using the Payment Plan services, you accept and agree to be
    				bound and abide by these Terms of Use. If you do not want to
    				agree to these Terms of Use, you must not access or use the
    				Payment Plan Services. 
    			  </p>

    			<section class="mb-3 mt-4">
    			  <h4>2. Use of the Payment Plan Services</h4>
    			  <p>
    				You may apply to use Rentable Finance’s Payment Plan services
    				(the “Payment Plan Services” or “Services”), which allow tenants
    				to pay the Security Deposit in monthly installments, rather than
    				entirely upfront. Participation in the Payment Plan involves a
    				monthly service fee (“Service Fee”). Use of the Payment Plan
    				Services require you to provide us with information to connect a
    				bank account and/or other payment methods, such as a credit
    				card, so that we can automatically charge the Service Fee to
    				your preferred payment method. 
    				<br />
    				<br />
    				By applying for and using the Payment Plan Services, you
    				authorize Rentable Finance to obtain consumer reports from
    				consumer reporting agencies and to use any obtained information
    				to provide you the SDMP and Payment Plan Services. By using the
    				Payment Plan Services you acknowledge that Rentable Finance may
    				report information about your use of the Payment Plan Services
    				to consumer reporting agencies, such as on-time, late, or missed
    				payments, defaults, and completion of payments. By applying to
    				use the Payment Plan Services you also authorize Rentable
    				Finance to request and obtain information from your landlord
    				about your payment and rental history. Rentable Finance has the
    				sole discretion to determine whether you are approved for
    				participation in Payment Plan Services and may choose not to
    				provide you with this service at any time for any reason,
    				including your creditworthiness. 
    				<br />
    				<br />
    				If you are approved to receive the Payment Plan Services,
    				you will receive a notification in your Rentable Management
    				Account (“RMA”) with the repayment specific terms for which you
    				have been approved. By accepting your personalized repayment
    				terms through your RMA, you agree to pay the full amount of the
    				security deposit within the specified amount of months, to make
    				an initial deposit in the specific amount, and to pay the
    				specified monthly service fee. You agree to and authorize
    				Rentable Finance to debit your banking account or charge any
    				other provided payment method for this same installment payment
    				and service fee each month until the final installment payment
    				is made and the full amount of the Security Deposit is received
    				by Rentable Finance. Rentable Finance reserves the right to
    				change or increase any service fees upon prior notice to you.
    				<br />
    				<br />
    				If you fail to make an installment payment or pay the
    				Service Fee, Rentable Finance reserves the right to collect
    				unpaid Service Fees from prior months along with the Service Fee
    				due for the current month. At move-out, if you are not required
    				to compensate Landlord for any damage pursuant to your
    				residential lease, Rentable Finance reserves the right to
    				collect any unpaid Service Fee by deducting the final balance of
    				Service Fees owed to Rentable Finance from your Security Deposit
    				prior to returning it to you. At move-out, if you are required
    				to compensate Landlord for damages exceeding the total amount of
    				installment payments you have made, you authorize Rentable
    				Finance to make service fee recovery efforts consistent with
    				these Terms and applicable laws, including authorization for
    				Rentable Finance to debit, charge, or setoff against or
    				otherwise recover funds from any connected account or payment
    				method. If such recovery efforts fail, you authorize Rentable
    				Finance to make modified recovery demands for all or less than
    				all of the owed amount, without prior written notice,
    				irrespective of whether such owed amounts are contingent,
    				matured, or unmatured. You agree that by using the Payment Plan
    				Services, such recovery efforts are acknowledged and authorized.
    				<br />
    				<br />
    				To cancel the Payment Plan, you must submit a
    				cancellation request to Rentable Finance. In order for Rentable
    				Finance to process your cancellation request, you are required
    				to provide a payment of the outstanding amount of the Security
    				Deposit still owed.
    				<br />
    				<br />
    				By using the Payment Plan Services, you agree and
    				acknowledge that you remain solely responsible for payment of
    				the full amount of the Security Deposit. You agree to allow
    				Rentable Finance or its agents to send you payment reminders,
    				via any form of communication that you have provided Rentable
    				Finance in your RMA.

    			  <h4>3. Rentable Finance’s Obligations</h4>
    			  <p>
    				Rentable Finance's sole obligation with respect to the Payment
    				Plan Services is to collect the structured installment payments
    				of the Security Deposit and hold the Security Deposit in escrow
    				as Landlord's agent and distribute each such Security Deposit on
    				the terms and conditions set forth in these Terms. The Security
    				Deposit is not the property of Rentable Finance; it remains the
    				property of Tenant subject to the terms and conditions of
    				Tenant's lease with Landlord and the conditions set forth in
    				Tenants account with Rentable. Rentable Finance has no
    				responsibility to provide Tenant with any notices, bank account
    				information, information regarding the Landlord, information on
    				the location or amount of the Security Deposit, information on
    				interest earned or credited to the account of the Tenant or any
    				other information regarding the requirements of laws in
    				connection with Security Deposits for rentals of residential
    				real estate. Any information of any nature provided to the
    				Tenant from any source connected with Rentable should be
    				confirmed with the Landlord to ensure accuracy and validity.
    				<br />
    				<br />
    				The duties, responsibilities and obligations of Rentable
    				Finance shall be limited to those expressly set forth herein,
    				and no additional duties, responsibilities or obligations shall
    				be inferred or implied. Rentable shall not be subject to, nor
    				required to comply with, any agreement between or among Landlord
    				and the Tenant (even though reference thereto may be made
    				herein), or to comply with any direction or instruction (other
    				than those contained herein or delivered in accordance with
    				these Terms of Use) from any party other than Landlord. Rentable
    				Finance shall not be required to, and shall not, expend or risk
    				any of its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability
    				in the performance of any of its duties hereunder.
    				<br />
    				<br />
    				Rentable Finance shall not be liable for any action
    				lawfully taken or omitted, or for any loss or injury resulting
    				from its actions or its performance or lack of performance of
    				its duties hereunder in the absence of bad faith, gross
    				negligence or willful misconduct on its part. In no event shall
    				Rentable be liable (i) for acting in accordance with or relying
    				upon any written instruction, notice, demand, certificate or
    				document from the Landlord, (ii) for any consequential, punitive
    				or special damages, or (iii) for an amount in excess of the
    				value of the Security Deposit in issue.
    				<br />
    				<br />
    				Rentable Finance may consult legal counsel of its own
    				choosing in the event of any dispute or question as to the
    				construction of these Terms of Use or Rentable Finance 's duties
    				hereunder, and Rentable will incur no liability and will be
    				fully protected with respect to any action taken or omitted in
    				good faith in accordance with the reasonable opinion and
    				instructions of such counsel.
    				<br />
    				<br />
    				Rentable Finance shall not incur any liability for not
    				performing any act or fulfilling any duty, obligation or
    				responsibility hereunder by reason of any occurrence beyond the
    				control of Rentable Finance (including but not limited to any
    				act or provision of any present or future law or regulation or
    				governmental authority, any act of God or war, or the
    				unavailability of the Federal Reserve Bank wire or telex or
    				other wire or communication facility).
    				<br />
    				<br />
    				If at any time Rentable Finance is served with any
    				judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, writ or
    				other form of judicial or administrative process which in any
    				way affects the Security Deposit (including but not limited to
    				orders of attachment or garnishment or other forms of levies or
    				injunctions or stays relating to the transfer of escrow
    				property), Rentable Finance is authorized to comply therewith in
    				any manner as it or its legal counsel of its own choosing
    				reasonably deems appropriate; and if Rentable Finance complies
    				with any such judicial or administrative order, judgment,
    				decree, writ or other form of judicial or administrative
    				process, Rentable Finance shall not be liable to any of the
    				parties hereto or to any other person or entity even though such
    				order, judgment, decree, writ or process may be subsequently
    				modified or vacated or otherwise determined to have been without
    				legal force or effect.
