                <h4>1. Introduction</h4>
                <p>
                  These Terms of Use (the “TOU” or “Terms”) are entered into by and
                  between you (the “Tenant”) and Rentable Technology Corporation
                  ("Company," "we," or "us"). The following terms and conditions,
                  together with the Rentable Privacy Policy, Dwolla’s Terms of
                  Service, and Dwolla’s Privacy Policy, govern your access to and
                  use of tryrentable.com (the “Website”) and the Security Deposit
                  Management System (the “SDMP”), including any content,
                  functionality, and services offered on or through the Website or
                  the SDMP.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  You must accept these Terms of Use in order to (i) use the Website
                  or (ii) create a SDMP account. Please read the Terms of Use
                  carefully before you start to use the Website or the SDMP. By
                  using the Website or SDMP, you accept and agree to be bound and
                  abide by these Terms of Use, the Rentable Privacy Policy, Dwolla’s
                  Terms of Use, and Dwolla’s Privacy Policy. If you do not want to
                  agree to these Terms of Use, you must not access or use the
                  Website or the SDMP.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  By agreeing to these Terms the Tenant authorizes Rentable to hold
                  and accrue interest on certain security deposit payments made by
                  Tenant to Landlord for the duration of the tenancy and engage in
                  certain other activities incidental thereto according to the Terms
                  herein.

                <p>
                  Each Tenant will create a Rentable Management Account (a “Rentable
                  Management Account” or “RMA”) in order to use the SDMP via the
                  Website.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Tenant recognizes that Rentable is the agent of the Landlord and
                  owes duties to the Landlord in providing the SDMP, and that
                  Rentable does not owe the Tenant any fiduciary duties or other
                  obligations except as specifically described in these Terms and
                  subject to any limitations provided herein.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Tenant confirms that the SDMP is a deposit management service
                  platform and not an electronic funds transfer service as defined
                  under applicable law.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  By accepting these Terms, Tenant agrees to comply with the privacy
                  policies, including sections regarding confidentiality of
                  information, of Rentable and its third-party vendor's set for
                  below in Section 5.

                <h4>3. Rentable's Obligations</h4>
                <p>
                  Rentable's sole obligation with respect to the SDMP is to hold the
                  Security Deposit in escrow as Landlord's agent and distribute each
                  such Security Deposit on the terms and conditions set forth in
                  these Terms. The Security Deposit is not the property of Rentable;
                  it remains the property of Tenant subject to the terms and
                  conditions of Tenant's lease with Landlord and the conditions set
                  forth in Tenants account with Rentable. Rentable has no
                  responsibility to provide Tenant with any notices, bank account
                  information, information regarding the Landlord, information on
                  the location or amount of the Security Deposit, information on
                  interest earned or credited to the account of the Tenant or any
                  other information regarding the requirements of laws in connection
                  with Security Deposits for rentals of residential real estate. Any
                  information of any nature provided to the Tenant from any source
                  connected with Rentable should be confirmed with the Landlord to
                  ensure accuracy and validity.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The duties, responsibilities and obligations of Rentable shall be
                  limited to those expressly set forth herein, and no additional
                  duties, responsibilities or obligations shall be inferred or
                  implied. Rentable shall not be subject to, nor required to comply
                  with, any agreement between or among Landlord and the Tenant (even
                  though reference thereto may be made herein), or to comply with
                  any direction or instruction (other than those contained herein or
                  delivered in accordance with these Terms) from any party other
                  than Landlord. Rentable shall not be required to, and shall not,
                  expend or risk any of its own funds or otherwise incur any
                  financial liability in the performance of any of its duties
                  hereunder.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Rentable shall not be liable for any action lawfully taken or
                  omitted, or for any loss or injury resulting from its actions or
                  its performance or lack of performance of its duties hereunder in
                  the absence of bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct
                  on its part. In no event shall Rentable be liable (i) for acting
                  in accordance with or relying upon any written instruction,
                  notice, demand, certificate or document from the Landlord, (ii)
                  for any consequential, punitive or special damages, or (iii) for
                  an amount in excess of the value of the Security Deposit in issue.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Rentable may consult legal counsel of its own choosing in the
                  event of any dispute or question as to the construction of these
                  Terms or Rentable's duties hereunder, and Rentable will incur no
                  liability and will be fully protected with respect to any action
                  taken or omitted in good faith in accordance with the reasonable
                  opinion and instructions of such counsel.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Rentable shall not incur any liability for not performing any act
                  or fulfilling any duty, obligation or responsibility hereunder by
                  reason of any occurrence beyond the control of Rentable (including
                  but not limited to any act or provision of any present or future
                  law or regulation or governmental authority, any act of God or
                  war, or the unavailability of the Federal Reserve Bank wire or
                  telex or other wire or communication facility).
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  If at any time Rentable is served with any judicial or
                  administrative order, judgment, decree, writ or other form of
                  judicial or administrative process which in any way affects the
                  Security Deposit (including but not limited to orders of
                  attachment or garnishment or other forms of levies or injunctions
                  or stays relating to the transfer of escrow property), Rentable is
                  authorized to comply therewith in any manner as it or its legal
                  counsel of its own choosing reasonably deems appropriate; and if
                  Rentable complies with any such judicial or administrative order,
                  judgment, decree, writ or other form of judicial or administrative
                  process, Rentable shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto
                  or to any other person or entity even though such order, judgment,
                  decree, writ or process may be subsequently modified or vacated or
                  otherwise determined to have been without legal force or effect.

                    The Tenant and Landlord must both have an RMA.

                    Landlord must send a Rentable Request to the Tenant. This
                    request will set out the Landlord's and Tenant's details and
                    details of the property, including the amount of the Deposit and
                    the Rental Term.

                    Once the Tenant accepts the Rentable Request sent to it, the
                    Deposit Sub-Account is created. Once the Deposit Sub Account is
                    created, Rentable will only release the Security Deposit (in
                    whole or in part) to either the Landlord or Tenant in accordance

                    Each Deposit Sub Account is separate and distinct from any other
                    Deposit Sub Account. For instance, if a Landlord has multiple
                    properties, a separate and distinct Deposit Sub Account is
                    created in accordance with Section 7 in respect of each Deposit
                    for each respective property.

                    By creating a Deposit Sub Account, the Landlord and Tenant agree
                    that the Deposit Sub Account shall in so far as is permissible
                    under applicable law prevail over any agreement, lease or

                  The Security Deposit continues to be the property of the Tenant. A
                  Landlord only has a contractual right to claim on the Deposit in
                  accordance with the terms of the lease and the laws of the state
                  where such Security Deposit is held.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Your RMA and the Security Deposit are not an asset or the property
                  of Rentable, and each is managed on behalf of the Landlord.

                <p>
                  The SDMP Fee is payable by the Tenant to Rentable for each Deposit
                  Sub Account.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The SDMP Fee is a one-time fee of 3% of the Security Deposit up to
                  a maximum of USD $15 or such other fee that has been agreed
                  between Rentable and the Landlord (or their agents) for each
                  Deposit Sub Account plus any applicable sales or other local tax.
                  This fee covers the SDMP provided hereunder beyond the maintenance
                  of the Security Deposit under the applicable lease. The Tenant is
                  under no obligations to select the SDMP that are covered by this
                  SDMP Fee, and the Tenant does so voluntarily.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The non-refundable SDMP Fee is payable when the Deposit Sub
                  Account is created in accordance with Section 7 herein.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  If Tenant pays any sums by credit or debit card, and later cancels
                  the payment, Tenant is required to pay us any charge we incur to
                  our payment processor as a result of the cancellation. We may
                  deduct this amount from any sums credited to your RMA or the
                  Security Deposit (in which case the person that made the
                  cancellation is then responsible for making a further payment
                  through its RMA to increase the Security Deposit to the amount
                  required under the Deposit Sub Account).
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  We can, at any time, change the SDMP Fee and notify you of such
                  change as set out herein. This change will apply for any Deposit
                  Sub Account which you create after the date of the change but
                  won't apply to any existing Deposit Sub Account. By continuing to
                  use the SDMP, you are deemed to have accepted such change.

                  Landlord agrees that Rentable can rely on any instruction
                  (including any mentioned in Section 10) through Landlord's RMA as
                  being an accurate, binding and final instruction from Landlord.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Landlord must ensure that all instructions are accurate and
                  complete and correctly identify the Security Deposit or other
                  amount and the nominated bank account for any payments.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  If Landlord gives Rentable an instruction within 9 am and 4 pm on
                  a Banking Day, Rentable will process this instruction as soon as
                  reasonably practicable, but such instruction may be processed on a

                  <br />
                  All transactions using the SDMP are subject to acceptance and
