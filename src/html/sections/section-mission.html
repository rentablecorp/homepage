				<div class="text font-weight-medium">
					As both renters and landlords in Boston, we experienced first hand the
					many inefficiencies with the security deposit process. As tenants, we
					dealt with trouble of having to go to the banks for certified checks
					and arguing over damage done to apartments. As landlords, we dealt
					with the administrative burden of handling these funds and the
					complications with accurately tracking move-in and move-out
					inspections.
