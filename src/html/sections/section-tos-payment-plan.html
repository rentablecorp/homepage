			  <h4>1. Introduction</h4>
			  <p>
				These Terms of Use (the “TOU” or “Terms”) are entered into by
				and between you (the “Tenant”) and Rentable Finance LLC
				(“Rentable Finance,” "Company," "we," or "us"). The following
				terms and conditions govern your access to and use of the
				Payment Plan services, including any content, functionality, and
				services offered on or through the Payment Plan services. The
				Payment Plan Services (defined below) and any additional
				services may be provided by Rentable Finance and/or any of its
				affiliates.
				<br />
				<br />
				You must accept these Terms of Use in order to use
				the Payment Plan Services. Please read these Terms of Use
				carefully before you start to use the Payment Plan Services. By
				using the Payment Plan services, you accept and agree to be
				bound and abide by these Terms of Use. If you do not want to
				agree to these Terms of Use, you must not access or use the
				Payment Plan Services.

			  <h4>2. Use of the Payment Plan Services</h4>
			  <p>
				You may apply to use Rentable Finance’s Payment Plan services
				(the “Payment Plan Services” or “Services”), which allow tenants
				to pay the Security Deposit in monthly installments, rather than
				entirely upfront. Participation in the Payment Plan involves a
				monthly service fee (“Service Fee”). Use of the Payment Plan
				Services require you to provide us with information to connect a
				bank account and/or other payment methods, such as a credit
				card, so that we can automatically charge the Service Fee to
				your preferred payment method. 
				<br />
				<br />
				By applying for and using the Payment Plan Services, you
				authorize Rentable Finance to obtain consumer reports from
				consumer reporting agencies and to use any obtained information
				to provide you the SDMP and Payment Plan Services. By using the
				Payment Plan Services you acknowledge that Rentable Finance may
				report information about your use of the Payment Plan Services
				to consumer reporting agencies, such as on-time, late, or missed
				payments, defaults, and completion of payments. By applying to
				use the Payment Plan Services you also authorize Rentable
				Finance to request and obtain information from your landlord
				about your payment and rental history. Rentable Finance has the
				sole discretion to determine whether you are approved for
				participation in Payment Plan Services and may choose not to
				provide you with this service at any time for any reason,
				including your creditworthiness. 
				<br />
				<br />
				If you are approved to receive the Payment Plan Services,
				you will receive a notification in your Rentable Management
				Account (“RMA”) with the repayment specific terms for which you
				have been approved. By accepting your personalized repayment
				terms through your RMA, you agree to pay the full amount of the
				security deposit within the specified amount of months, to make
				an initial deposit in the specific amount, and to pay the
				specified monthly service fee. You agree to and authorize
				Rentable Finance to debit your banking account or charge any
				other provided payment method for this same installment payment
				and service fee each month until the final installment payment
				is made and the full amount of the Security Deposit is received
				by Rentable Finance. Rentable Finance reserves the right to
				change or increase any service fees upon prior notice to you.
				<br />
				<br />
				If you fail to make an installment payment or pay the
				Service Fee, Rentable Finance reserves the right to collect
				unpaid Service Fees from prior months along with the Service Fee
				due for the current month. At move-out, if you are not required
				to compensate Landlord for any damage pursuant to your
				residential lease, Rentable Finance reserves the right to
				collect any unpaid Service Fee by deducting the final balance of
				Service Fees owed to Rentable Finance from your Security Deposit
				prior to returning it to you. At move-out, if you are required
				to compensate Landlord for damages exceeding the total amount of
				installment payments you have made, you authorize Rentable
				Finance to make service fee recovery efforts consistent with
				these Terms and applicable laws, including authorization for
				Rentable Finance to debit, charge, or setoff against or
				otherwise recover funds from any connected account or payment
				method. If such recovery efforts fail, you authorize Rentable
				Finance to make modified recovery demands for all or less than
				all of the owed amount, without prior written notice,
				irrespective of whether such owed amounts are contingent,
				matured, or unmatured. You agree that by using the Payment Plan
				Services, such recovery efforts are acknowledged and authorized.
				<br />
				<br />
				To cancel the Payment Plan, you must submit a
				cancellation request to Rentable Finance. In order for Rentable
				Finance to process your cancellation request, you are required
				to provide a payment of the outstanding amount of the Security
				Deposit still owed.
				<br />
				<br />
				By using the Payment Plan Services, you agree and
				acknowledge that you remain solely responsible for payment of
				the full amount of the Security Deposit. You agree to allow
				Rentable Finance or its agents to send you payment reminders,
				via any form of communication that you have provided Rentable
				Finance in your RMA.

			  <h4>3. Rentable Finance’s Obligations</h4>
			  <p>
				Rentable Finance's sole obligation with respect to the Payment
				Plan Services is to collect the structured installment payments
				of the Security Deposit and hold the Security Deposit in escrow
				as Landlord's agent and distribute each such Security Deposit on
				the terms and conditions set forth in these Terms. The Security
				Deposit is not the property of Rentable Finance; it remains the
				property of Tenant subject to the terms and conditions of
				Tenant's lease with Landlord and the conditions set forth in
				Tenants account with Rentable. Rentable Finance has no
				responsibility to provide Tenant with any notices, bank account
				information, information regarding the Landlord, information on
				the location or amount of the Security Deposit, information on
				interest earned or credited to the account of the Tenant or any
				other information regarding the requirements of laws in
				connection with Security Deposits for rentals of residential
				real estate. Any information of any nature provided to the
				Tenant from any source connected with Rentable should be
				confirmed with the Landlord to ensure accuracy and validity.
				<br />
				<br />
				The duties, responsibilities and obligations of Rentable
				Finance shall be limited to those expressly set forth herein,
				and no additional duties, responsibilities or obligations shall
				be inferred or implied. Rentable shall not be subject to, nor
				required to comply with, any agreement between or among Landlord
				and the Tenant (even though reference thereto may be made
				herein), or to comply with any direction or instruction (other
				than those contained herein or delivered in accordance with
				these Terms of Use) from any party other than Landlord. Rentable
				Finance shall not be required to, and shall not, expend or risk
				any of its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability
				in the performance of any of its duties hereunder.
				<br />
				<br />
				Rentable Finance shall not be liable for any action
				lawfully taken or omitted, or for any loss or injury resulting
				from its actions or its performance or lack of performance of
				its duties hereunder in the absence of bad faith, gross
				negligence or willful misconduct on its part. In no event shall
				Rentable be liable (i) for acting in accordance with or relying
				upon any written instruction, notice, demand, certificate or
				document from the Landlord, (ii) for any consequential, punitive
				or special damages, or (iii) for an amount in excess of the
				value of the Security Deposit in issue.
				<br />
				<br />
				Rentable Finance may consult legal counsel of its own
				choosing in the event of any dispute or question as to the
				construction of these Terms of Use or Rentable Finance 's duties
				hereunder, and Rentable will incur no liability and will be
				fully protected with respect to any action taken or omitted in
				good faith in accordance with the reasonable opinion and
				instructions of such counsel.
				<br />
				<br />
				Rentable Finance shall not incur any liability for not
				performing any act or fulfilling any duty, obligation or
				responsibility hereunder by reason of any occurrence beyond the
				control of Rentable Finance (including but not limited to any
				act or provision of any present or future law or regulation or
				governmental authority, any act of God or war, or the
				unavailability of the Federal Reserve Bank wire or telex or
				other wire or communication facility).
				<br />
				<br />
				If at any time Rentable Finance is served with any
				judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, writ or
				other form of judicial or administrative process which in any
				way affects the Security Deposit (including but not limited to
				orders of attachment or garnishment or other forms of levies or
				injunctions or stays relating to the transfer of escrow
				property), Rentable Finance is authorized to comply therewith in
				any manner as it or its legal counsel of its own choosing
				reasonably deems appropriate; and if Rentable Finance complies
				with any such judicial or administrative order, judgment,
				decree, writ or other form of judicial or administrative
				process, Rentable Finance shall not be liable to any of the
				parties hereto or to any other person or entity even though such
				order, judgment, decree, writ or process may be subsequently
				modified or vacated or otherwise determined to have been without
				legal force or effect.

			  <h4>4. Limited Warranty, Limitations of Liability and Indemnity </h4>
			  <p>
				In the event of any breach of these Terms by Rentable Finance,
				Rentable Finance's sole obligation, with respect to a written
				claim of breach made by Tenant, shall be to remedy the breach to
				the extent that such remedy is commercially practicable.
